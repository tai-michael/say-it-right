She has one younger sister who is in high school. Emily is very organized and likes to plan out her day in advance, making a to-do list with two or three tasks. She also enjoys running and usually goes for a jog around the park at six in the morning. Emily's favorite number is twelve, which is the number of hours of sleep she needs to feel fully rested.",
